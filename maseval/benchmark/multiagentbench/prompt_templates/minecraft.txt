Evaluate the following Minecraft collaborative building task performance.

Task: {task}

Result:
{result}

Rate each dimension on a scale of 1-5:
- structural_completeness: Were all required blocks placed to complete the structure?
- blueprint_accuracy: How closely does the final build match the blueprint specifications (materials, positions, facing)?
- coordination: How well did agents coordinate block placement, material retrieval, and scaffolding?
- efficiency: How efficiently was the task completed (minimal wasted actions, good division of labor)?

Respond with a JSON object:
{{"structural_completeness": <score>, "blueprint_accuracy": <score>, "coordination": <score>, "efficiency": <score>}}
