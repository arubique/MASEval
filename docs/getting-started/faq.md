# FAQ

## Q: Who is this library for?

Anyone! We had a few groups in mind when building MASEval.

1. **Benchmark Developers**: Researchers proposing new benchmarks for multi-agent systems can use MASEval to handle all the boilerplate.
2. **Benchmark Consumers**: Researchers studying multi-agent systems can use MASEval as a unified interface across different benchmarks.
3. **System Comparison**: Developers who want to test different agentic systems against each other can do so with MASEval.

## Q: I am looking for a specific feature, but I cannot find it.

1. Check this documentation.
2. If the feature does not exist, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/parameterlab/MASEval/issues/new). Feature requests are welcome.
3. Consider implementing it yourself. Check out the [contributing guide](contributing.md) for details.

## Q: Can I only test multi-agent systems?

No. MASEval works well for single-agent systems too. We designed the library to handle the complexity of multi-agent systems, but single-agent evaluation is fully supported. You can even run model comparisons, for example GPT against Claude.
